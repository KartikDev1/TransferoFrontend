//SEND MODAL
Key changes made:

Added a tabbed interface to switch between single file and group file mode

Added new state variable sendMode to track the current mode

Modified the UI to show appropriate content based on the mode:

Different titles and icons

Different button labels

Different success messages

Updated the success view to show:

Single file QR code and code in single mode

Group QR code and group code in group mode

Added validation to prevent sending multiple files in single mode

Added Folder icon for group mode

Updated the API response handling to support group codes (you'll need to update your backend to return groupQrCodeBase64 and groupCode when in group mode)
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Note: You'll need to update your backend API to:

Handle group file uploads differently than single files

Return a group QR code and group code when in group mode

Package multiple files into a single group with a shared code

The backend should return something like this for group uploads:

json
{
  "groupCode": "GRP123",
  "groupQrCodeBase64": "base64-encoded-qr-code",
  "files": [
    { "shortCode": "ABC123", "qrCodeBase64": "...", "originalFileName": "file1.jpg" },
    { "shortCode": "DEF456", "qrCodeBase64": "...", "originalFileName": "file2.pdf" }
  ]
}
